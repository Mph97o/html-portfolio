<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I was born and raised in Gauteng, South Africa and Graduated from University
  of Limpopo in 2019. I kind of always knew that i wanted to do things related
  to website and app development since I love computers. I came across Udemy as
  a reccomendation from a friend. At first I was sceptical about joining Udemy,
  I thought it would not have a lot of informative content due to its prices but
  the minute I bought and enrolled on the bootcamp, i knew Udemy was the one for
  me.

  Currenty I'm working hard to complete this bootcamp as my goal is to find a
  role in the tech industry. There's a lot I am learning from this bootcamp, I
  won't lie challanges are there but mostly importantly they are assisting with
  grasping and understanding the content way better. Being stuck and trying to
  figure out where you went wrong it can be stressful and frustrating at times
  but after getting the code correct the feeling in amazing and it gives an
  enthusiasm to continue to learn more. I can't wait to complete the bootcaamp
  and get my dream job.
